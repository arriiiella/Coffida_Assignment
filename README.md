# Coffida_Assignment

This is my assignment for my final year Mobile Applications Development module. 
The assignment scenario is the following:

CoffiDa is platform for reviewing the best local coffee spots. Anybody can use CoffiDa for finding the
best local Café’s, but Users who sign up for an account can also publish reviews. Reviews consist of a
series of ratings (e.g. quality, price, cleanliness) along with a short body of text for describing their
experience. Users can also comment on, and ‘like’ other reviews.
The CoffiDa team have an existing Web application that interacts with their back-end RESTful API.

However, a decision has been made by the CoffiDa company directors to enhance usability through
the development of a mobile front end. CoffiDa has hired you to develop a mobile application for
them.

The CoffiDa team are dictating that the application is to be developed using React Native with a
focus on initially delivering an Android project. The plan is that future iterations of the project will
look towards adapting your codebase and rolling out an iOS equivalent.
